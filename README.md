This is a mobile application built using **React Native** and **Expo** that allows users to browse, search, and book events. The app interacts with a mock API to simulate real-world functionality, making it an excellent tool for understanding event booking systems.

- **Event Listings**: View a list of available events with essential details such as title, date, location, and images.
- **Search Functionality**: Easily find events by searching with keywords.
- **Event Details**: Click on any event to see detailed information and a "Book Now" button.
- **Mock API Integration**: The app uses a mock API to fetch event data, allowing for realistic interaction without the need for a backend setup.
